## 3in1Clock
#### Final

This clock uses the variables: seasons, months, and the moon cycles. The seasons are represented through the colors of middle square: green represents Spring, yellow is Summer, brown is Fall, and blue is winter. The figure rotates like a pendulum based on the moon cycle values, and the middle square grows in size based on each passing month.
