#### Potential project topics & questions

1. Ozone Layer Depletion: Data on the status of the ozone layer within the past two decades. https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/

2. Sea Level Rise: As the temperature of the Earth changes, so does sea level. Temperature and sea level are linked for two main reasons: Changes in the volume of water and ice on land (namely glaciers and ice sheets) can increase or decrease the volume of water in the ocean and as water warms, it expands slightlyâ€”an effect that is cumulative over the entire depth of the oceans. https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level

3. Carbon emissions: Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels. https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data

4. Greenland ice melting status: This dataset shows the loss in mass of Greenland ice since 2002. https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/key-indicators/greenland

5. Antarctica ice melting status: This dataset shows the loss in mass of Antarctic ice since 2002. https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/key-indicators/antarctica

6. Global electricity consumption: Net consumption of electricity worldwide in select years from 1980 to 2018. https://www.statista.com/statistics/280704/world-power-consumption/
