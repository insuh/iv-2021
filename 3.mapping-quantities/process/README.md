This folder contains the three charts exported from the Thousand Suns spreadsheet data and three additional illustrator sketches. The charts reflect the average total country groundheight, average percentage of seismic activity, and yearly yield average of the UK and PRC.

The External Data Sketches show the yearly yield data of each bomb type which is converted to the amount of fireworks needed to be of the equivalent energy yield.
